# Hackers_Week_UMA
Repository for the Hackers Week presentation about Blockchain.


In this respository you can find an example of an Ethereum Smart-Contract developed in Solidity language.

You can copy and paste the code into http://remix.ethereum.org in order to get familiar with Smart-Contracts and play with the different functions available.
